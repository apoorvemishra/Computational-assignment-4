For 10,000 uniform deviates :-
Both linear congruential random number generator and np.random.rand() took 0 seconds, that is less then the least count of my computer.
But if I increase the number of deviates,
For 100,000 uniform deviates:-
linear congruential random number generator starts to take 0.015641 seconds, that is some small finite time.
But np.random.rand() still takes 0 seconds.
